# BashScripts
A collection of bash scripts I have made. Documentation will be provided below.

# Message of the Day (motd.sh)

* * *
The script right now only has support for plaintext documents with the .txt file extension. This is simply for organization purposes. 

The syntax of the script is as follows. 

`/path/to/file/motd.sh /path/to/txt/ "Example Message"`

Obviously stuff will break if you put in values you're not supposed to. So don't do it.
